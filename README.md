## About this Project

This a project I wrote back in 2007 as a Ruby learning exercise. At the time, I was having issues with subtitles being in ASS/SSA format and my video player didn't handle them as well as SRT files. So this converted the subtitle files in one format to another.

The ultimate plan was to have a collaborative subtitling site, but I dropped the project.

## Usage

Deploy to a server that handles running straight Ruby. To be honest, I haven't tested this since then.
